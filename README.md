## AR with HTML Workshop

Do you want to make Augmented Reality using the web? In this workshop, we will augment the world around us without installing any applications, using just HTML. 

To bring the digital content to life, we will introduce the idea of AR markers. During the workshop, each participant will design their own poster that incorporates a customized AR marker. At the end of the workshop, each participant will leave with a unique experience to take home.
